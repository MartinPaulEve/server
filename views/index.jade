      If we want to bring about a more open community we’ll need more tools, more information and more engagement around the issue.

      strong That’s where our idea comes in. 
      |Imagine a browser-based tool which allowed you to track every time someone
      |was denied access to a paper? Better yet, imagine if that tool gave you
      |basic information about where in the world they were or their profession
      |and why they were looking. Integrating this into one place would create a
      |realtime, worldwide, interactive picture of the problem. The integration
      |of social media would allow us to make this problem visible to the world.
      |Lastly, imagine if the tool actually helped the person gain access to the
      |paper they’d been denied access to in the first place. Incentivising use
      |and opening the barriers to knowledge combined can make this really
      |powerful.

    p
      |That’s what we’re imagining. We’re calling it the 
      strong Open Access button
      |. Every paywall met is an isolated incident; it’s time we capture those
      |individual moments of injustice and frustration to turn them into positive
      |change. We’ve figured out how all this and more can be done – If you’re a
      |programmer, we’d love your help creating a basic prototype to prove this is
      |a viable idea. After that our dreams include a having a slick website to
      |provide a home for the button and an accompanying campaign. If you have
      |anything you feel that can help us and you want to help create change to
      |move towards a more open world join us by contacting 
      a(href='mailto:oabutton@gmail.com') oabutton@gmail.com
